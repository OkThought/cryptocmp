cryptocmp
=========

Python wrapper for `CryptoCompare API`_

Description
-----------

``cryptocmp`` provides to the `CryptoCompare API`_ in two ways:

-  Straight wrappers of the API calls in ``cryptocmp.api`` package.
-  A more user friendly mapping to these wrappers in object-oriented
   style via the following classes:

   -  ``cryptocmp.coin.Coin`` represents a crypto coin.

Installation
------------

::

   pip3 install cryptocmp

or this can also work if you have only python3 installed (the symlink
``pip`` pointing to ``pip3`` is created)

::

   pip install cryptocmp

Usage
-----

Examples
~~~~~~~~

In object-oriented style:

-  Get a set of all available crypto coins:
   
   >>> from cryptocmp.coin import Coin   
   >>> Coin.all()   
   {'EOSDAC', 'GAP', 'ARN', 'SERA', 'ICASH', 'STAR*', 'AC3', ...}

   
-  Get a current price of BTC in USD:
   
   >>> from cryptocmp.coin import Coin   
   >>> bitcoin = Coin('BTC')   
   >>> bitcoin.price('USD')   
   6318.35``
   
-  Get a current price of BTC in USD, EUR and GBP at the same time
   (produces single API call under the hood):
   
   >>> from cryptocmp.coin import Coin   
   >>> bitcoin = Coin('BTC')   
   >>> bitcoin.price(('USD', 'EUR', 'GBP'))   
   {'USD': 6316.17, 'EUR': 5540.34, 'GBP': 4977.23}``
